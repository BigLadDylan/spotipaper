### CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS...
*"works on my machine"*...but wont work on yours.

It connects to spotify's api through `spotipy` and as a result reveals my api token. 

Contains a lot of AI code so i could see how easy it was to implement, turns out pretty easy...
WIll update this repo with instructions on how you could set it up when I have some time. 

For now, be jealous.
